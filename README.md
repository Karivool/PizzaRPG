## How to play

Clone this repo and make sure you have Python 2 installed on your computer.

From the command line, type `python pizzarpg.py` and press Enter (or from your choice of GUI, navigate to the folder and double click `pizzarpg.py` and it should load if you have `.py` files associated with Python). The game should begin and instructions are given throughout.
